# ===== Radme me file on HTML & CSS Project ====
This project is the continuation of the **Advanced HTML module**,
focusing entirely on applying **modern CSS** to build a clean,
responsive, and visually accurate webpage based on a provided Figma
design. The goal is to reproduce the UI **pixel-perfectly**, using
**only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

All HTML and CSS code must be **fully W3C-compliant** and pass official
validation.

#🎯 Project Overview

This project challenges learners to convert a professional UI/UX design
(provided in Figma) into a functioning web page. Learners will:

-   Analyze visual components in Figma\
-   Implement layout systems (Flexbox)\
-   Apply advanced styling techniques\
-   Ensure perfect structure using semantic HTML\
-   Create a responsive experience on all screen sizes

Build every component manually --- **no frameworks, no CSS
libraries, no JavaScript libraries**.

## 🎨 Figma Design Access

The complete design specification for this project is available in
**Figma**.

To access:

1.  Create a free account at https://www.figma.com\
2.  Open the shared Figma link provided in your project instructions\
3.  Inspect the design to derive:
    -   Colors\
    -   Typography\
    -   Spacing\
    -   Layout structure\
    -   Components and responsive behavior

> 🔒 **Note:** You are NOT allowed to auto-export code or assets
> directly from Figma. All styling must be written manually.
